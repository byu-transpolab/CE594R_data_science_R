# What is git?

<https://r-bio.github.io/intro-git-rstudio/>

Show examples of github repositories

# In-class exercise:

## Connecting to the R-Script

[Install R & R-Studio]<https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>

[R installation]<https://cran.rstudio.com/>

Select R for proper OS

For Windows\
“Install for the first time” “Download R-4.2.3 for Windows” Follow
Prompts for setup R-Studio installation: follow setup prompts

## Install Git

Follow Link below. Follow Prompts for setup Git - Downloading Package
[git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/)

## Create Git-Hub Account

<https://github.com>\
Create or login to account Email Dr. Sonntag your username to invite
your individual class repository

## Introduce yourself to Git (if you haven’t used Git before)

See Chapter 7 here: <https://happygitwithr.com/hello-git>

## Create a Github folder in your documents folder

Such as for me on windows: "C:\Users\Sonntag\Github"

## Connect Git to R-Studio, and clone public class repository


File, New Project, Version Control, Git
    Save it in your new Github folder on your computer

Paste directory URL from Git-Hub site 
<https://github.com/byu-transpolab/CE594R_data_science_R>

green “\<\>code” button copy repository URL Ensure you have pulled most
recent code/scripts

You just ‘cloned’ the CE594R_data_science_R Git-hub repository to your
local machine

Because it is public, you all can view the contents of this repository

## Clone your own private repository for doing your homework and your class project

I created these for each of you with your last name. I will add you after you have emailed me your github username


Navigate to Git-Hub site

[https://github.com/byu-transpolab](https://github.com/byu-transpolab)

Then navigate to the repository:

CE594R_data_science_R_[last_name]

green “\<\>code” button copy repository URL Ensure you have pulled most
recent code/scripts

        
You just ‘cloned’ the CE594_[last_name] Git-hub repository to your local machine

Now, clone a public repository for general information for the class

Because this is private, only those to whom you give permission will be
able to see the contents

## Troubleshooting:

If this doesn’t work, Review steps 4 through 12 here: (Note there is an
appendix A)

https://happygitwithr.com/install-git

## Optional:

Install Github Desktop This is a GUI interface for working with Git
<https://desktop.github.com/>

## In-class exercise #1

Clone both the private the github repository

Create an r script.

Inclass_1.R.

Put some text in the script.

Save your file in the Inclass exercise folder in your github repository

Commit and push your r script to your personal repository.

Go to Github.com. and see your file on the cloud.

Add an issue to your github repository. Leave a message to
@darrell_sonntag, and let me know that you submitted your first github
assignment On learning suite, submit the link to your assignment to get
