## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents.

Good introduction here <https://intro2r.com/rmarkdown_r.html>

For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
#Valid R code goes here
```

## Example

Here's a code chunk called summary-stats

Hit the green play button to run the code chunk

```{r, summary-stats}
x <- 1:10    # create an x variable
y <- 10:1    # create a y variable
dataf <- data.frame(x = x, y = y)

summary(dataf)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r summary-plot, echo=FALSE}
plot(dataf$x,dataf$y)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot. We will see that later after we 'knit' the Rmarkdown document

Q: What are 3 differences between Markdown Files and scripts? A:

1.  R Markdown files have text outside of code chunks (generally) and script files need to have text always commented (\#) out.
2.  Script files output code results in the console, whereas markdown files output in the console and right below the code chunk.
3.  R Markdown files are made to be knitted whereas script files are not.
4.  (Bonus) Scripts do not have the header at the top (called a YAML), but Markdown files do.

## Parts of an R markdown file

Intro here <https://intro2r.com/r-markdown-anatomy.html>

### Meaning of Hashtags

Hashtags are used for headings

Here it shows the font size for headings. Comments don't need to be commented out.

# Heading 1

## Heading 2

### Heading 3

#### Heading4

##### Heading 5

###### Heading 6

### bullets

-   item 1
-   item 2
    -   sub-item 2
    -   sub-item 3
-   item 3
-   item 4

### numbered lists

1.  item 1
2.  item 2
    -   sub-item 2
    -   sub-item 3
3.  item 3
4.  item 4

### Code chunks

> To include R code into your R markdown document you simply place your code into a ‘code chunk’. All code chunks start and end with three backticks \`\`\`. Note, these are also known as ‘grave accents’ or ‘back quotes’ and are not the same as an apostrophe! On most keyboards you can find the backtick on the same key as tilde (\~).

From <https://intro2r.com/r-markdown-anatomy.html>

To add a code chunk, click the green +C square above, or Code-\> Insert Chunk.

# Look at different options different options code chuck names

These include echo=FALSE (hide code), results='hide' (hide result), include=FALSE (hide both code and results)

A good summary is located here: <https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf>

### Add a code chunk below

make a dataframe of your family's names and ages, and calculate the mean age all in one chunck








You can also embed R code into text. Surround it with the back quotes\`\`,and then add the R code.

For example, the mean age of my family is `r mean(family$age)`.

### Formatted tables

### R studio Source or Visual

Click the "Visual" button in R studio to get a preview, then select Insert Table,

Insert a table with two columns, and the number of people in your family. Add there names and ages






Now print a nice formatted table using the knitr package





Options on the kable function are provided here:

<https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/tables.html>

### Add a formatted equation

Equations are formatted using LaTeX style

An overview of LaTex are here

<https://pages.uoregon.edu/torrence/391/labs/LaTeX-cheat-sheet.pdf> <https://rmd4sci.njtierney.com/math>

Add a code chunck to calculate the distance of vehicle traveling at constant acceleration and initial speed the following equation to calculate

<!-- d=v*t+(1/2)a*t^2 -->

Note this is how you comment out text in rmarkdown Ctrl + Shift + C

<https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/comments.html>

Solve for d when\
v is 4 m/s, t is 10 sec, and a is 1 m/s





Now print out the equation you used

Now print out the equation for the volume of a sphere


Now Hit the ball of string icon to knit the document to an html
