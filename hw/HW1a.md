# HW1a
Complete six lessons in swirl, an R package for learning R in R, written by Roger Peng, Brooke Anderson, and Sean Kross. 

Each lesson might take 10-15 minutes.

In a text file, record the lesson names and a very brief description of what you learned from each. Save this file in your local R Project in the appropriate directory (e.g., /homework) and commit/push the file with regular updates to your private GitHub repository.
Follow the steps here to install, load, and start swirl. When you are prompted to install a course, you can load “R Programming,” which covers material related to the recent class lectures. 

Please complete the following swirl lessons:

-	Module 1: Basic Building Blocks
-	Module 2: Workspace and Files
-	Module 3: Sequences of Numbers
-	Module 4: Vectors
-	Module 5: Missing Values
-	Module 6: Subsetting Vectors

swirl lessons have a mix of base R and tidyverse approaches, so don’t be alarmed or discouraged if you see some unfamiliar techniques or concepts. 

If you are already familiar with this content, select 6 different modules such as:

- “lapply“ in the course “R programming”

or lessons in other courses such as: 

- "Exploratory Data Analysis” 
- “Statistical Interference”

Information on other swirl courses are here: https://swirlstats.com/students.html

- install_course(“course_name”) such as 
- install_course(“statistical_interference”)


Special swirl commands
In the swirl environment, knowing about the following commands will be helpful:

-	The prompt ... indicates you should press enter to continue in the lesson.
-	skip(): skip current question
-	play(): temporarily exit swirl
-	nxt(): return to swirl after play()ing around in the console
-	main(): return to swirl’s main menu
-	bye() or “escape” key: exit swirl
