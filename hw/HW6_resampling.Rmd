Read in the data we used for HW5

We will evaluate the vehicle emissions data we evaluated in HW5. 

Let's evaluate confidence intervals for the emission rates of nitrogen oxide (NO), from gasoline vehicles. 

Let's evaluate the 'summer.2022.gas' dataset. 

Let's just look at the MY 1994 and newer vehicles, that have electronic vehicle emission tests. 

Create a dataset called summer.2022.gas.NO

- filter to just the compliance in Compliant, Not Compliant and NOnIM
- filter to just the pollutant == NO
- filter to model year 1995 and laters
- remove missing NO emission rates

```{r}
summer.2022.gas.NO <- summer.2022.gas 
                    #filter

  
```

Plot box plots of the data. With panels for each location, the model year on the x-axis, and different colors for each 
Compliance level (dodged). You can use the code below

```{r}
ggplot(data = summer.2022.gas.NO, aes(x = year_cuts, y = ER, color= Compliance)) +
geom_boxplot(position = position_dodge(width = 0.5),width=0.5) +
facet_wrap(.~ location, scales = "free_y") +
labs(title = "NO emission rates by location, model year, and Compliance level",
     x = "MY group",
     y = "NO g/kg") +
theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size=8, angle=90,hjust = 1, vjust =0.2))

Calculate the means and 95% CI of the mean for each groups 

Let's calculate the means by 3 model year groups (using year_cuts), compliance status, and location

Then, let's calculate the 95% CI using the t-distribution

$$
\bar{x}\,\pm t_{\alpha/2,n-1} \, \cdot \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
$$

```{r}
NO.loc.comp.summary <- 

```
Plot the means for each of the group with 95% CI

Plot Model year on the x-axis
ER on the y-axis
Separate panels for each location
Dodge by Compliance



```{r}


```

Question: Which error bars are the widest?
Question: What is the n for these groups?

Answer: 


The wide confidence intervals for some of the groups, makes is difficult to observe differences in others. 

Let's plot the means again for each of the group with 95% CI

Except this time, let's have separate panels for location AND model year group
Plot Compliance on the x-axis
Add the number of observations in each group using geom_text

```{r}



```
Like the plot below:

Question: How many of the confidence intervals include 0?

Answer: 



Notice the 95% confidence intervals using the t-distribution are very large---

for some groups, the large N may compensate for the data being highly skewed and non-normal. 

However, for the small samples or samples with large outliers the distribution of the means may not be well approximated with a t-distribution. 

Let's use resampling to calculate 95% confidence intervals that are useful for non-normal and small sample size data

First let's use the loop method. 

We have 3 locations X 3 compliance levels X 3 model year groups = 27 unique groups

We could subdivide the data into 27 unique groups...and then resample from each (like we did in class)

And then resample using a for loop
However, that would be difficult with 27 unique groups. 

I created two functions that does the resampling. The first 1 uses loops, the second uses a function from moderndive (preferred)

Function 1: 

I created the looping function here: 


```{r}

resample_cars <- function(data.i){
                  
                     }

```

Function 2 (preferred)

When I tried the above function with loops it took way too long...( sometimes it wouldn't finish it for me)

So, I used the rep_sample_n function within my function from the moderndive package

<https://moderndive.com/8-confidence-intervals.html#original-workflow>

```{r}
resample_cars <- function(data.i){
            
                  #resample <- rep_sample_n( #d
                  # 
                  }

```


Apply the resample_cars() function use the group_by, group_split, map, and list_rbind

Info on the group_split here. 
<https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/group_split.html>

map

<https://purrr.tidyverse.org/reference/map.html>

Map() I applied the function I created above. Map
returns a list of output. I then used list_rbind() to bind all the
list elements of the back together into a dataframe/tibble).

You could also use the base R version of split(), and then use lapply()


```{r}
resample.NO <- summer.2022.gas.NO  %>%
                       # group_by( %>%  
                       #group_split %>%
                       #map
                       #list_rbind

```

Summarize the means by replicate 

```{r}

names(resample.NO)

resample.NO.means <- 
                              
```

Calculate the 2.5 and 97.5% quantiles

```{r}

resample.NO.intervals <- 
```
Plot histograms of the resample means for each group, with the 95% CIs like the figure below 

```{r}

#ggplot(data = resample.NO.means,aes(x = sample_mean,fill=Compliance )) + 
  #geom_histogram
  #geom_vline
  #geom_vline
  #facet_wrap(.~location + year_cuts+Compliance, scales='free') +
  #theme_bw()+
  #labs(x='group', y= 'NO g/kg')  +
  #theme(strip.text = element_text(size=8),legend.position="none")

#ggsave("../../CE594R_data_science_R/figs/NO_resampling_means.png")

```

Question: Why do some of the resampling mean distributions have multiple modes, or clusters?

Answer: Some of the samples have 1-2 very large outliers. For example: Timp Hwy East - Not compliant 2016-2023, has 38 vehicles, with one very large outlier. If the resample includes multiple occurances of the high emitting vehicle, the mean is significantly higher. So, each cluster represents the high emitting vehicle being present 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 times in the resample. 



Repeate the plot of the means with with error bars for the 95% quantiles, with 
separate panels for year cuts and location (like your second plot) 

Like the plot below

![](../../CE594R_data_science_R/figs/NO_resampling_conf.png)

```{r}


```
How many of groups have confidence intervals that include zero?

Now just 5 of the 27 groups have confidence intervals that include zero
(dropped from 9). 


Bind the summary data from the two methods together, and graph them side by side


```{r}



```

How are the 95% confidence intervals different between the two methods?
