Follow the steps here to install, load, and start swirl. When you are prompted to install a course, you can load “R Programming,” which covers material related to the recent class lectures. 

Please complete the following swirl lessons:
-	Module 7: Matrices and Data Frames
-	Module 8: Logic

swirl lessons have a mix of base R and tidyverse approaches, so don’t be alarmed or discouraged if you see some unfamiliar techniques or concepts. 

If you are already familiar with this content, select 4 different course such as “lapply“ in R programming, or lessons in other courses such as Exploratory Data Analysis.” Or “Statistical Interference”

Information on other swirl courses are here: https://swirlstats.com/students.html

You can install other courses by using the command
- install_course(“course_name”) such as 
- install_course(“statistical_interference”)
