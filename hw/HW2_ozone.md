# HW2 Ozone analysis

- Conduct your analysis using an Rmarkdown .rmd document
- Read in the file "Ozone Data_corrected.xlsx" in the hw folder in the public class repository
  - Call it ozone.data
  - Use read_excel
- select the following columns:
  - House.Number
  - Visit
  - Location
  - ppm
  - LOD ppm
- Filter out the rows with House.Number = NA
- Create a new logical variable called "O3.below.det" (TRUE/FALSE)
  - Values that are below the detection limit have a "<" sign
  - TRUE values are when the "ppm" values are below the detection limit
  - Use the function str_detect() (it's the tidyverse version of grepl in base R)
- Create a new  variable "O3.ppm" from the ppm variable, convert it to a numeric variable
- Create a new column called O3.estimate that is the "O3.ppm", or if it is below the detection limit, it is the value of "LOD ppm"
- Set House.Number, Visit, Location as factors
- Read in IndoorAir_houseinfo.xlsx as house.info
  - This includes the type of air conditioner
  - that identifies the house.type of each home
- Join the house.info to the measured data
- Summarize "O3.ppm" and "O3.estimate" including the mean, max, minimum, and number of non-missing measurements grouped by:
  - location
  - Type of Air Conditioning

- 
- reshape the data to a wide format, using pivot_wider
