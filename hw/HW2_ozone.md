# HW2 Ozone analysis

-   Conduct your analysis using an Rmarkdown .rmd document
    -   Display all your R code (make sure echo=TRUE)
-   Read in the file "Ozone Data_corrected.xlsx" in the hw folder in the public class repository
    -   Call it ozone.data
    -   Use read_excel
-   select the following columns:
    -   House.Number
    -   Visit
    -   Location
    -   ppm
    -   LOD ppm
-   Filter out the rows with House.Number =='BLANK'
-   Create a new logical variable called "O3.below.det" that contains True or FALSE,
    -   TRUE values are when the "ppm" values are below the detection limit
    -   Values that are below the detection limit have a "\<" sign
    -   Use the function str_detect() (it's the tidyverse version of grepl in base R)
-   Create a new variable "O3.ppb" from the ppm variable, convert it to a numeric variable, and multiply it by 1000 (to convert from ppm to ppb)
-   Create a new variable called O3.estimate that is in units of ppb. Set the value to "O3.ppb" , unless the measurement is below the detection limit, then set the value of "LOD ppm"\*1000
    -   We are imputing (substituting) the missing values with the limit of detention as the maximum possible value
    -   Use the if_else() function
-   Set House.Number, Visit, Location as factors
-   Read in IndoorAir_houseinfo.xlsx as house.info
    -   This includes the type of air conditioner
    -   that identifies the house.type of each home
-   Join the house.info to the measured ozone data
-   Create a summary table called ozone.data.summary
    -   Return the total number of measurements, and the number of measurements
    -   the mean, median, min, and max of "O3.ppb"
    -   measurements grouped by:
        -   Location
        -   Type of Air Conditioner
            -   Note, because there are spaces in `Type of Air Conditioner` refer to the column using the back apostrophe
            -   Or rename it with a name with no spaces
    -   display the ozone.data.summary in a formatted table using kable
-   Make a wide table with O3.estimate in two separate columns for In and Out locations
    -   Calculate a new variable called the Indoor/Outdoor ratio which is the indoor O3 concentration divided by the outdoor O3 concentration for each visit.
    -   Display the equation of the Indoor/Outdoor (I/O) O3 ratio using LaTeX in an equation block. Include the subscript the 3 in O3.
-   Summarize the Indoor/Outdoor O3 ratio by the type of air conditioning type (Central and Evaporative), including the number of measurements, the mean, median, min and max.
-   Embed the number and the mean indoor/outdoor ratio for the two types of air conditioners in a sentence or two. Round the mean values to two decimal points.
    -   The indoor/outdoor ratio for the x visits in the Central Air homes was y.
    -   The indoor/outdoor ratio for the z visits in the Evaporative Cooler homes was z.
-   Knit the document to an html document. Make sure to suppress any warning messages in any of the code-chunks
