## Plotting networks

I had a homework problem where I needed to find the traffic volumes and times it took to get from zones A and B to zone D as shown in the figure. 

![](../figs/init_net.png)

I was able to plot the network in r.

In this tutorial, I will use ggraph and tidygraph to plot a network. Below are some resources to learn a little more about what they do. 

-   ggraph <https://ggraph.data-imaginist.com/>
-   tidygraph <https://tidygraph.data-imaginist.com/>

To make networks, ggraph needs information about the nodes and edges of the data. 
The edges are the lines connecting the nodes.

We will start by creating the node and edge data using the as_tble_graph function from tidygraph. 

It will convert a datafram with to from variables into a node and edge format, or it will convert a matrix to the same format. 

```{r}
network_df <- data.frame(from = c("A", "A","A",
                                  "B", "B","B",
                                  "C","C","C"), 
                         to = c("A","B","C",
                                "A","B","C",
                                "A","B","C"),
                         volumes = c(30, 20, 15,
                                     15, 25, 12, 
                                     5, 18, 22))

network_mtx <- matrix(c(10,20,30,
                        15,25,12,
                        5,18,22), 
                      nrow = 3,
                      byrow = T)

?as_tbl_graph

df_tbl_graph <- network_df %>% as_tbl_graph()

mtx_tbl_graph <- network_mtx %>% as_tbl_graph() %>% 
  mutate(name = c("A","B","C"))

```

Using ggraph
```{r}

ggraph(mtx_tbl_graph) +
  geom_edge_link()


ggraph(mtx_tbl_graph) +
  scale_edge_color_distiller(palette = "Reds") +
  geom_edge_link(aes(color = weight, width = weight),
                 arrow = arrow(type = "open"), 
                 end_cap = circle(1,"cm")) +
  geom_node_point(size = 7)

```

Making it look nice
```{r}

ggraph(df_tbl_graph) +
  geom_edge_link(aes(color = volumes, width = volumes),arrow = arrow(type = "closed", length = unit(.5, "cm")), 
                 end_cap = circle(1,"cm")) +
  geom_node_point(size = 7) +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = name), color = "white") +
  theme_void()
```

geom_edge_fan
```{r}
ggraph(df_tbl_graph) +
  geom_edge_fan(aes(color = volumes, width = volumes),arrow = arrow(type = "closed", length = unit(.5, "cm")), 
                 end_cap = circle(1,"cm")) +
  geom_node_point(size = 7) +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = name), color = "white") +
  theme_void()
```

geom_edge_diagonal
```{r}
ggraph(df_tbl_graph) +
  geom_edge_diagonal(aes(color = volumes, width = volumes),arrow = arrow(type = "closed", length = unit(.5, "cm")), 
                 end_cap = circle(1,"cm")) +
  geom_node_point(size = 7) +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = name), color = "white") +
  theme_void()
```



Some code that I used to make custom colors
```{r}

df_tbl_graph <- df_tbl_graph %>% 
  mutate(node_size = c(4, 6, 8))

ggraph(df_tbl_graph) +
  geom_edge_diagonal(aes(color = volumes, width = volumes),arrow = arrow(type = "closed", length = unit(.5, "cm")), 
                 end_cap = circle(1,"cm")) +
  geom_node_point(aes(size = node_size)) +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = name), color = "white") +
  theme_void()







# network %>% 
#   ggraph() +
#   scale_edge_colour_gradient(
#   low = "grey",
#   high = "darkred",
#   space = "Lab",
#   na.value = "grey50",
#   guide = "edge_colourbar",
#   aesthetics = "edge_colour"
# ) +
#   geom_edge_fan0(aes(colour = Volumes, width = Times))+geom_node_label(aes(label = name),
#                   label.padding = unit(0.5, "lines"),
#                   label.r = unit(.7, "lines")) +
#   theme_void()
# ggsave("images/loaded_network.png")

```
